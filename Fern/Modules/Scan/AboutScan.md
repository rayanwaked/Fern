# About the "Scan" Subdirectory

## Overview

The "Scan" subdirectory of the Fern app contains components for barcode scanning functionality. These components allow users to scan barcodes using the device camera and display the corresponding product information. The files within this subdirectory include:

1. `ScanModel.swift`
2. `ScanView.swift`

Each file plays a specific role in handling barcode scanning and displaying the scanned product details.

## Files and Documentation

### 1. `ScanModel.swift`

#### Description

`ScanModel.swift` defines the `ScanModel` structure, which is responsible for managing the barcode scanning functionality using `AVFoundation` to access the device camera and process the barcode data.

#### Key Components

- **`ScanModel` struct:** Conforms to `UIViewRepresentable` to integrate a UIKit view into SwiftUI.
  - **Properties:**
    - `detectedBarcode`: A binding variable to store the detected barcode.
  - **Methods:**
    - `makeCoordinator`: Creates a coordinator to handle `AVCaptureMetadataOutputObjectsDelegate`.
    - `makeUIView`: Creates and configures the `UIView` for barcode scanning.
    - `updateUIView`: Updates the `UIView` when SwiftUI state changes.
  - **Coordinator class:**
    - Acts as a delegate for `AVCaptureMetadataOutput`.
    - Processes detected barcodes and updates the `detectedBarcode` property.

### 2. `ScanView.swift`

#### Description

`ScanView.swift` defines the `ScanView` structure, which is a SwiftUI view that manages the user interface for barcode scanning and displaying the scanned product information.

#### Key Components

- **`ScanView` struct:**
  - **Properties:**
    - `detectedBarcode`: A state variable to store the detected barcode.
  - **Body:**
    - A `VStack` that displays the `ScanModel` view if `detectedBarcode` is empty.
    - Displays the `ProductView` with the scanned barcode once a barcode is detected.

- **`#Preview`:** Provides a preview of `ScanView` for testing in SwiftUI previews.
